//How to add relation ship between tables:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
CREATE TABLE orders
(
	order_id 	   INT PRIMARY KEY,
	customer_id INT NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customers (customer_id)
	REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
	ON UPDATE  CASCADE,
	ON DELETE NO ACTION
)

//ALTERING primary and foreign key constraints 

Creating Relation ship after creating the table

ALTER TABLE orders
	DROP PRIMARY KEY,
	ADD PRIMARY KEY (order_id),
	DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customers,
	ADD FOREIGN KEY fk_orders_customer(customer_id)
	REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
	ON UPDATE CASCADE
	ON DELETE NO ACTION;

//Character Sets and collations:
'abc'
Character Set is a table that matches each character to a number.
Some of them supports latin language and some supports the asian language and some of them supports all international languages.

eg : utf8 - it supports all international languages.This is default characterSet in  MySql

collation :Bunch of rows that determine how the characters in a given language are sorted.
utf8_general_ci : Here it is case insensitive maxlen :3 bytes.

CHAR(10) -> 10*3 =30
SHOW CHARSET


CREATE DATABASE db_name
	CHARACTER SET latin1

ALTER TABLE table1
	CHARACTER SET latin1

IN COLUMNS 
first_name VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL


//STORAGE ENGINES :
Storage Engines determines how the data is stored and what featues are available to us.

SHOW ENGINES
commonly used MYISAM(old default ) ,InnoDB (present default)

ALTER TABLE customers
ENGINE = InnoDB

//Don't do this at production level
