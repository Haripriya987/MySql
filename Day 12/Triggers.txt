Trigger :
A block of sql code that automatically gets executed before or after an insert,update or delete statement.
we often use triggers to enforce data consistency.

//covention for a trigger creation
--table_after/before_insert/update/delete

DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER payment_after_insert
	AFTER INSERT ON payments
	FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	UPDATE invoices
	SET payment_total=payment_total + NEW.amount
	WHERE  invoice_id=NEW.invoice_id;

END $$

DELIMITER ;

//

INSERT INTO payments
VALUES (DEFAULT,5,3,'2019-01-01',10,1)

//
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER payment_after_delete
	AFTER DELETE ON payments
	FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	UPDATE invoices
	SET payment_total=payment_total - OLD.amount
	WHERE  invoice_id=NEW.invoice_id;

END $$

DELIMITER ;

//
DELETE 
FROM payments
WHERE payment_id=10;

Viewing Triggers:
SHOW TRIGGERS
//
SHOW TRIGGERS LIKE 'payments%'

Dropping Triggers:

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS  payment_after_insert;


//Using Triggers for auditing

USE sql_invoicing;
CREATE TABLE payments_audit
(
	client_id INT
	date	DATE
	amount	DECIMAL(9,2)
	action_type   VARCHAR(50)
	action_date  DATETIME
